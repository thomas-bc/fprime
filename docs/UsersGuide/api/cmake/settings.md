## settings.cmake:

Required build settings for building against the fprime framework. This list **should** be kept small, only setting
items that are strictly required for building fprime. Settings must be restricted to items that are required to ensure
fprime builds properly.

Required settings:
- C standard 99
- C++ 11 standard, fprime uses C++11 items
- UT flags overrides
